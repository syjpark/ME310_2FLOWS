# ME310_2FLOWS

This is a basic Arduino code for the 2FLOWS system (to be) presented at EXPE 2018.

The current code is based on proxy sensors: pH sensor and turbidity sensor. We would like to stress that these are proxy for an array of sensors to be used for the full-fledged system.
The input from these two sensors controls the solenoid valve to be turned on or off accordingly.

The links for the exact equipments purchased for our particular system are included.
